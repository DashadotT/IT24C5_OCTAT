                My first experience with web development was both exciting and challenging. I started by creating a
                simple webpage using HTML and CSS. At first, it was a bit overwhelming because I had to learn new
                concepts and terms. However, I quickly realized that breaking things down made it easier.
                The first step was understanding what HTML is. I learned that it’s the language used to create the
                structure of a webpage. I created a basic layout with headings, paragraphs, and images. Seeing my text
                and pictures appear on the screen for the first time was a rewarding experience. It made me feel like I
                was building something from scratch.
                Next, I moved on to CSS, which is used to style the webpage. I learned how to change colors, fonts, and
                spacing. It was amazing to see how a few simple lines of CSS could transform my plain HTML page into
                something visually appealing. I enjoyed experimenting with different styles, like making the background
                color bright and the text bold.
                One of the key challenges I faced was figuring out how to position elements on the page. At first,
                things didn’t align the way I wanted them to. However, with practice and some trial and error, I learned
                about margins and padding, which helped me create a more organized layout.
                I also discovered the importance of testing my webpage in different browsers. It was interesting to see
                how the design looked on Chrome versus Firefox. This taught me that web development isn’t just about
                writing code; it’s also about making sure everything works well for users.
                In summary, my first web development activity was a mix of excitement and learning. I gained a better
                understanding of HTML and CSS and learned the importance of structure and design. This experience
                sparked my interest in web development and made me eager to learn more. Each small step I took helped me
                grow, and I look forward to building more complex projects in the future!
